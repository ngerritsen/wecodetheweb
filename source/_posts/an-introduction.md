Hi, my name is Niels. I am a front-end/web developer from the Netherlands. I opened this blog to share my experiences about front-end development with the world! The main topics will be Javascript, React, Angular, Sass, Gulp and everything involving front-end development.

I am excited to see how this blog will work out. Also feel free to comment and discuss your ideas with me and everyone else, feedback on my blog is also welcome!

See ya!
